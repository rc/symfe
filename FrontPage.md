SymFE will be a library for symbolic finite element calculations in pure Python, based on [SymPy](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/). Optionally, it will seamlessly provide an interface (invisible to user) to other packages for symbolic computations accessible from Python, namely [swiginac](http://swiginac.berlios.de/), for users willing speed.
